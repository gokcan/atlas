## Hello visitor! Welcome to Atlas, the programming language for propositional calculus and more.
## Atlas' syntax is similar to language we use in our daily lives. It is also type-safe and efficient.
## It is also highly inspired from Kotlin, Swift and Python.

pure truth 'earth is flat' = false; ## cannot be assigned again, because you know, it is "pure".
